[{"content":"My name is Jan Kol√°rik and I\u0026rsquo;m a software engineer currently working in Red Hat.\nI first discovered Linux when I was 14 years old and a few years later I started using it as my main operating system.\nRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve entered the world of open source as a developer, which has been my dream for a long time.\nI have experience mainly with C++, C# and Python languages and I love applying test-driven development principles in my projects wherever it\u0026rsquo;s possible. Currently I am also discovering the beauties of Rust.\n","permalink":"https://jan-kolarik.github.io/about/","summary":"About me","title":"About"},{"content":" Last weekend I\u0026rsquo;ve attended FOSDEM 2023 conference with my colleagues from the Red Hat RPM software management team. We gave a talk about the DNF5 package manager which will be the new default in Fedora Linux soon.\nIt was the first time for me speaking in public at such a huge event and it was really exciting. This whole meetup was very energizing. Lot of different positive vibes from various tracks. I hope I\u0026rsquo;ll make it there again next year.\nIf you are more interested, you can visit this link and see a recording of our presentation or any other talk from the conference.\n","permalink":"https://jan-kolarik.github.io/posts/dnf5-fosdem2023/","summary":"Presenting the upcoming Fedora Linux package manager in Brussels","title":"DNF5 at FOSDEM"}]
