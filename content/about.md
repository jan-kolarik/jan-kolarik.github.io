My name is Jan Kol√°rik and I'm a software engineer currently working in Red Hat.

I first discovered Linux when I was 14 years old and a few years later I started using it as my main operating system.

Recently, I've entered the world of open source as a developer, which has been my dream for a long time.

I have experience mainly with C++, C# and Python languages and I love applying test-driven development principles in my projects wherever it's possible. Currently I am also discovering the beauties of Rust and delving into Kubernetes technology.
