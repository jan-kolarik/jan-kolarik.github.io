Three weeks ago, I presented at our internal Red Hat event, QEcamp. This event serves as a platform for discussing all aspects related to quality and testing. What makes it exceptional is its inclusivity â€” it brings together not just quality engineers but associates from various departments, fostering discussions around the topic of quality.

My contribution included an overview presentation on test-driven development, where I shared the basics and my experience with this alternative approach to the conventional development process.
