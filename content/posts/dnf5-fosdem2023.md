Last weekend I've attended FOSDEM 2023 conference with my colleagues from the Red Hat RPM software management team. We gave a talk about the DNF5 package manager which will be the new default in Fedora Linux soon. 

It was the first time for me speaking in public at such a huge event and it was really exciting. This whole meetup was very energizing. Lot of different positive vibes from various tracks. I hope I'll make it there again next year.
