<p>I first discovered Linux when I was 14 years old and a few years later I started using it as my main operating system.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve entered the world of open source as a developer, which has been my dream for a long time.</p>
<p>I have experience mainly with C++, C# and Python languages and I love applying test-driven development principles in my projects wherever it&rsquo;s possible. Currently I am also discovering the beauties of Rust.</p>

<p>Last weekend I&rsquo;ve attended FOSDEM 2023 conference with my colleagues from the Red Hat RPM software management team. We gave a talk about the DNF5 package manager which will be the new default in Fedora Linux soon.</p>
<p>It was the first time for me speaking in public at such a huge event and it was really exciting. This whole meetup was very energizing. Lot of different positive vibes from various tracks. I hope I&rsquo;ll make it there again next year.</p>
